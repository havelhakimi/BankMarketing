# Anomaly Detection on BankMarketing Dataset
This a solution notebook to an assignment question given in a Data Mining graduate course. Each code block is accompanied by relevant analysis wherever required. </br>
Dataset link: https://github.com/GuansongPang/ADRepository-Anomaly-detection-datasets/blob/main/numerical%20data/DevNet%20datasets/bank-additional-full_normalised.csv </br>
Broadly, the following steps have been performed in this solution notebook:
<ul>
<li> Applied different statistical measures and presented them on infograph. </li>
<li> Count plot and classwise categorical plot for categorical attributes  <\li>
<li> Histogram plot for continuous attribute</li>
<li > Pie chart depciting class distribution </li>
<li > Correlation Analysis <\li>
</ul>
<li>Using KNN as baseline model and training it on the dataset </li>
<li> Dimensionality Rediction using PCA and retarining the model using reduced dimension </li>

  
<li> Clustering using DBSCAN to remove anomalies and retraining the model after removal of anomalies</li> 


<li> Trained Decision Tree model to identify anomalies on test set. Followed by retraining the model after anomalies removal</li>
  
 </ul>
These above assumptions and the flow of work is according to the questions asked in assignment.
